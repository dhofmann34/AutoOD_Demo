# STAND
A self-tuning anomaly detection system to address the challenges of method selection and hyper-parameter tuning while remaining unsupervised. STAND frees users from the tedious manual tuning process often required for anomaly detection by intelligently identifying high likelihood inliers and outliers and leveraging novel human-in-the-loop components that effectively utilize domain user feedback to meet application specific needs. STAND features a responsive visual interface allowing for seamless human-in-the-loop interactions to guide the tuning process with user's domain knowledge. 

STAND outperforms the best unsupervised anomaly detection methods, yielding results similar to supervised methods that have access to ground truth labels.
