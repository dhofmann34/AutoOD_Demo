# A Demonstration of AutoOD: A Self-Tuning Anomaly Detection System
AutoOD is a self-tuning anomaly detection system to address the challenges of method selection and hyper-parameter tuning while remaining unsupervised. AutoOD frees users from the tedious manual tuning process often required for anomaly detection by intelligently identifying high likelihood inliers and outliers. AutoOD features a responsive visual interface allowing for seamless user interaction providing the user with insightful knowledge of how AutoOD operates.

AutoOD outperforms the best unsupervised anomaly detection methods, yielding results similar to supervised methods that have access to ground truth labels.
